<Passage Stage="5" id="psge_1"  JokesGroupId="Jokes_1" desc=" A little boy was afraid of the dark. One night his mother told him to go out to the garden at the back and bring her the broom. The little boy turned to his mother and said, 'Mama, I don’t want to go out there. It’s dark.' 
The mother smiled reassuringly at her son. 'You don’t have to be afraid of the dark,' she explained. 'God is out there. He’ll look after you and protect you.' 
The little boy looked at his mother real hard and asked, 'Are you sure he’s out there?'
 'Yes, I’m sure. He is everywhere, and he is always ready to help you when you need him,' she said.
The little boy thought about that for a minute and then went to the back door and cracked it a little. Peering out into the darkness, he called, 'God? If you’re out there, would you please hand me the broom?' " Use="L,T,P" BloomsTaxonomy="1,2,3">

 <Passage Stage="5" id="psge_4"  JokesGroupId="Jokes_4" desc="A magician was working on a cruise ship. The audience would be different each week, so the magician allowed himself to do the same tricks over and over again. There was only one problem: The captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the magician did every trick. Once he understood he started shouting in the middle of the show: 'Look, it's not the same hat' 'Look, he is hiding the flowers under the table' 'Hey, why are all the cards the Ace of Spades?' The magician was furious but couldn't do anything; it was, after all, the captain's parrot. One day the ship had an accident and sank. The magician found himself on a piece of wood in the middle of the ocean with the parrot, of course. They stared at each other with hate, but did not utter a word. This went on for a day and another and another. After a week the parrot said: 'OK, I give up. Where's the boat?'
